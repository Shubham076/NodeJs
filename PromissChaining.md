 How Promise Chaining Works When the JavaScript engine encounters the following promise chain:

```js
promiseA
  .then(callbackB)
  .then(callbackC)
  .catch(callbackD);
```


### Phase 1

- Synchronous Setup (Initial Execution) The code runs from top to bottom, setting up the entire promise chain immediately. During this phase:

- promiseA is the starting point. It's an initial promise, perhaps from an asynchronous operation like fetch or setTimeout. Its state is pending.

- The .then(callbackB) method is called on promiseA. This call does two things synchronously:

- It registers callbackB to be executed when promiseA resolves.

- It creates and returns a new, pending promise (let's call it promiseB).

- The .then(callbackC) method is called on promiseB (the new promise from the previous step). This also happens synchronously:

- It registers callbackC to be executed when promiseB resolves.

- It creates and returns another new, pending promise (let's call it promiseC).

- The .catch(callbackD) method is called on promiseC. This is a shorthand for .then(null, callbackD):

- It registers callbackD to be executed if promiseC (or any preceding promise in the chain that hasn't handled the rejection) is rejected.

- At the end of this phase, the entire promise chain is built, and all callbacks are registered. The initial code has finished executing.

### Phase 2: Asynchronous Execution 

(Event Loop and Microtasks) This phase begins when promiseA settles (resolves or rejects), which happens asynchronously.

- promiseA Resolves: Once promiseA successfully completes its operation, its state changes from pending to fulfilled.

- The engine immediately places callbackB onto the microtask queue.

- callbackB Execution: Once the call stack is empty, the event loop takes callbackB from the microtask queue and executes it.

- The return value of callbackB is used to resolve promiseB.

- promiseB Resolves: promiseB is now fulfilled, so its registered callback, callbackC, is placed onto the microtask queue.

- callbackC Execution: The event loop runs callbackC.

- The return value of callbackC is used to resolve promiseC.

#### If a rejection occurs at any point:

If promiseA rejects, callbackB is never put on the microtask queue. Instead, the engine looks for the next .catch() in the chain. callbackD is registered to promiseC, which is part of the chain after the rejection point, so it is the one that will be executed.

The reject value of promiseA becomes the value next catch() block callback that is callbackD

callbackD is then placed on the microtask queue and executed to handle the error.

In essence, the promise chain is a series of dominoes. The initial code sets up all the dominoes (.then() calls) in a line. The initial promise (promiseA) is the first domino to fall. When it falls, it triggers the next one, which triggers the next one, and so on, with each .then() callback being an action that pushes the next domino. The microtask queue is the mechanism that ensures each domino falls only after the one before it has completely settled.
